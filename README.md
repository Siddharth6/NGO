	Our NGO has played a crucial role in helping the needy in society. We care and provide education to the children living in 
        the SLUMS Area and even providing education to those people who are unable to go to school. Our leading causes are providing primary education, 
        vocational training, self-employment, legal aid, and protection for women and self -awareness programs.
